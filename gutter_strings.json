'Falling off the face of the Earth' implies that the person disappeared.\n\n'Something didn't smell right' means something about it might not be good. `So I plugged my nose and took the job' is more wordplay.

Feel free to change to something that works better.\n\nIn the game's fiction, a slang term for being addicted to Coral is 'chasing the ruby slippers.' This is made of two references: the first is that being addicted to opium was called 'chasing the Dragon'; the Ruby Slippers are a reference to Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz.
