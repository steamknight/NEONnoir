> The acid rain washed the city's neon blood into the Gutter; home for those who ran out of options.

> The Gutter wasn't just a cliche metaphor, it was the city's most ruthless and dangerous district. Few chose to live there willingly; when your credits ran dry, there was nowhere else to go.

NEONnoir is a hybrid point-and-click adventure/visual novel game for the Amiga 1200.

This game was created over 5 months for the Amiga Blitz Basic Game Jam whose purpose was to bring few faces into that community and help share knowledge of Blitz Basic programming.

This repository contains the NEONnoir game as well as the rudimentary editor used to create the game. Over the course of the next few months, I'll be updating the game's engine and tools to make it easier for anyone to make point-and-click adventure or visual novel games for the Amiga.
